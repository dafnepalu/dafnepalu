### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a linguistics post-grad and a junior full-stack developer with experience in academic research, teaching, and the tech industry. As a linguist, I'm an expert at picking patterns out of complex language data generated by humans and understanding human behavior from subtle language cues. As a developer, I'm interested in delivering valuable software and optimizing communication between clients and development teams.
